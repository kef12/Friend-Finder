# Friend-Finder

## Description

*Friend Finder* takes in results from users' surveys and compares their answers with those from other users. The user will be given a list of ten questions to which they should respond by ranking values ranging from one (1) to five (5). When the survey is submitted, the application will compare the current survey results with the results of all other user surveys and match two users according to the lowest absolute difference between their respective scores.

The application uses [Node.js] and [Express] server on the back end and the [Materialize] CSS framework on the front end.
